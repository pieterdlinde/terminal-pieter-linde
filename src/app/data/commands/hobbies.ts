Outside of work I enjoy spending time with family and friends. 
I love the outdoors and like to spend most of my time outside when the weather allows it. 
I am a qualified PADI Open Water Scuba Diver and look forward to discovering new creatures 
and plants with each dive. I also enjoy traveling and experiencing new cultures 
from around the world. In total I have visited 8 countries thus far. I am a food 
lover and enjoy cooking and baking in my spare time.
